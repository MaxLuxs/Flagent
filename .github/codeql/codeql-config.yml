# CodeQL config: exclude generated/vendor docs and build artifacts from security scanning.
# Swagger UI docs (api-docs.html, api-reference.html, backend/docs/index.html) are
# single-file bundles of third-party libs; CodeQL flags patterns we do not control.
# Also exclude: e2e (localStorage for Playwright), docs/script.js, all build output
# (frontend Kotlin/JS, javadoc search-page.js), and sample apps (demo code).
